Updated Requirements

<p>The upcoming MAME 0.215 release will be the last version that can be
compiled with GCC 5 or GCC 6.  Going forward, the minimum supported
compiler will be GCC 7.2 or clang 5.  The <a
href="https://www.mamedev.org/tools/">Windows development tools</a>
have included GCC 7.4 for some time already, so you won’t need to update
update unless you haven’t in a very long time.</p>

<p>MAME 0.217 will be the last release with pre-built 32-bit Windows
binaries supplied.  Starting in 2020, you’ll need to compile MAME
yourself if you want a 32-bit version.  We’ll still support building
for 32-bit architectures, but optimisation for 32-bit x86 will not be a
priority.</p>
