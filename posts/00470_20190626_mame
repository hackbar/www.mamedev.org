MAME 0.211

<p>As we pass the half-way point of 2019, it’s time for MAME 0.211, with
all the excitement that brings.  In this release, SGI Indy and MIPS
RC2030 workstations have been promoted to working.  This is a major
milestone in RISC workstation emulation.  If you’re feeling nostalgic,
why not try one of them out, and install Irix or Windows NT for MIPS,
respectively?  This release also includes better support for the China
Education Computer Apple II derivatives, along with a preliminary
software list.  This opens a window to Chinese classroom technology
in the late ’80s and early ’90s.  Speaking of software lists, we’ve
added over five hundred cleanly cracked Apple II software titles, and
imported a whole lot of ZX Spectrum cassette images.</p>

<p>Looking away from computer emulation for a moment, Game &amp; Watch
preservation keeps progressing, with the addition of Ball (the earliest
Game &amp; Watch release) and the panorama screen version of Donkey
Kong Jr.  The Gaelco/Salter Pro Cycle Tele Cardioline exercise system
has been promoted to working, and the Pro Stepper system has been added.
System 573 MP3 audio has been greatly improved in this release, and
support has been added for more Bally pinball sound boards.  ClawGrip
added example programs from the V.R. Technologies VT03 software
development kit.  Gemcrush, a rare brick breaking arcade game, has been
added in this release.</p>

<p>There are lots of other improvements, including a fix for the fatal
error when switching away from MAME in Direct3D full-screen mode.
