MAME 0.220

<p>In a world of uncertainty, perhaps you can derive a little comfort
from MAME 0.220, our delayed release for the March development cycle.
This month has seen fixes for some old bugs in Final Star Force, Ribbit!
and Night Slashers, emulation of Crab Grab (the other Game &amp; Watch
title with a colour overlay), the acquisition of Solite Spirits (an
early version of what became 1945k III), and preliminary work on the
Naruto TV game running on the XaviX 2 platform.  There are some big
software list updates this month, including a lot of Apple II software
aimed at North Dakota schools, and the latest VGM music packs.  Speaking
of which, the VGM player can now show pretty visualisations while you
listen.</p>

<p>Newly supported peripherals include the Baby Blue II CPU Plus card
for PC compatibles, serial and CP/M modules for the HP 85 and HP 86,
more sound and disk expansions for the TI-99 family, the CoCo PSG
cartridge, and a variety of 8-bit Acorn expansions.  We’ve added ROM
dumps for a lot of synthesisers in this release, and while most of them
are not working yet, they’re there to tinker with if you’re
interested.</p>

<p>As always, you can read about all the updates in the <a
