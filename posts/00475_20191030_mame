MAME 0.215

<p>A wild MAME 0.215 appears!  Yes, another month has gone by, and it’s
time to check out what’s new.  On the arcade side, Taito’s incredibly
rare 4-screen top-down racer Super Dead Heat is now playable!  Joining
its ranks are other rarities, such as the European release of Capcom‘s
19XX: The War Against Destiny, and a bootleg of Jaleco’s P-47 –
The Freedom Fighter using a different sound system.  We’ve got three
newly supported Game &amp; Watch titles: Lion, Manhole, and Spitball
Sparky, as well as the crystal screen version of Super Mario Bros.
Two new JAKKS Pacific TV games, Capcom 3-in-1 and Disney Princesses,
have also been added.</p>

<p>Other improvements include several more protection microcontrollers
dumped and emulated, the NCR Decision Mate V working (now including
hard disk controllers), graphics fixes for the 68k-based SNK and Alpha
Denshi games, and some graphical updates to the Super A'Can driver.</p>

<p>We’ve updated bgfx, adding preliminary Vulkan support.  There are
some issues we’re aware of, so if you run into issues, check our
<a href="https://github.com/mamedev/mame/issues/">GitHub issues</a>
page to see if it’s already known, and report it if it isn’t.  We’ve
also improved support for building and running on Linux systems without
X11.</p>

<p>You can read about everything that’s been updated in the <a
