MAME 0.214

<p>With the end of September almost here, it’s time to see what goodies
MAME 0.214 delivers.  This month, we’ve got support for five more
Nintendo Game &amp; Watch titles (Fire, Flagman, Helmet, Judge and
Vermin), four Chinese computers from the 1980s, and three Motorola CPU
evaluation kits.  Cassette support has been added or fixed for a
number of systems, the Dragon Speech Synthesis module has been emulated,
and the Dragon Sound Extension module has been fixed.  Acorn Archimedes
video, sound and joystick support has been greatly improved.</p>

<p>On the arcade side, remaining issues in Capcom CPS-3 video emulation
have been resolved and CD images have been upgraded to CHD version 5,
Sega versus cabinet billboard support has been added to relevant games,
and long-standing issues with music tempo in Data East games have been
worked around.</p>

<p>Of course there’s much more, and you can read all about it in the <a
