Program:
- "And there was MUSIC!".  Thanks to Ishmair's FM engine, music is supported
  in Commando, Ghosts 'n Goblins, Diamonds.  Since the synthesis is based
  on FM generation via OPL, you must have a SoundBlaster, Adlib, or compatible
  to get the music.  However I heavily dislike this approach and I'm looking
  for documentation on FM generation.  If anyone want to join to the party
  forward me a mail!

- I'v also fixed GALAGA hiscore saving, which is now flawlessy supported! ;)

- I'v added Kung Fu Master driver to MAME.  Credits fly to Ishmair for the
  hardware information and to Nicola for fixing my sprite bugs.

- Steven Hugg (hugg@pobox.com) provided a Williams games driver.  Stargate,
  Robotron and Joust are currently supported and playable.  However Robotron
  and Joust have some glitches yet.

- Tormod Tjaberg (tormod@sn.no) provided several modifications to Invaders
  Deluxe driver which has now Hi-score Name saving feature (the only one
  Space Invaders Emulator doing so at the moment!).  All Invaders have now
  Tilt too.  Keys and Dip Switch adjusted.  REMEMBER TO DELETE PREVIOUS
  .DSW and .KEY FILES.

- John Butler and Ed. Muller provided a driver for QIX!  High Score saving
  supported too.

- Thankx to Dock Cutlip (dockc@cyberplanet.net) Pacman Plus has now 100%
  arcade correct colors.

- While talking of colors, Ghosts 'n Goblins has 100% correct colors too!
  Thanks to Gabrio Secco that provided us the complete colors LOG file ;)

- I'v fixed Seicross which is now playable and has music too.  REMEMBER TO
  DELETE PREVIOUS .DSW FILE, AND SET "DEMO & DEBUG MODE" TO OFF.

- Also fixed Nibbler colors:  I should say 100% correct colors, but I
  remember the Nibbler hairs were Green versus Purple.  Maybe I played a
  bootleg version.

- Added Phoenix TPN clone ("phoenix3").  I'v also added hiscore support to
  all Phoenix and Pleiads as well.

- Fixed the "ape" bug in Kangaroo.

- Full rotation allowed in Mad Planets (Thanks to Andrew Scott).

- Some fix to Popeye and Burgertime sound pitch.
