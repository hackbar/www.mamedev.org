- This is a bug fix version.  I did a mess with the famous heavy modifications
  I mentioned before.  Well, I was the first to try the feeling of working on
  wrong sources ;)  Funny!!  BTW, now everything is back to normality, Pacman,
  Galaxians, Centipede, and others.  I have learned a thing:  never work until
  4.30am in the morning :>

- Thanks to Gary Walton, Nicola added 100% correct colors in Mr Do's Castle
  Fixed also a bug in Ghosts 'n Goblins hiscore saving.  Now GnG does the
  self test too.

- Some credits that were left out in this file only, last time:  Thanks to
  Al Kossow, Hedley Rainnie and Eric Smith for the code to their vecsim
  emulator which had emulated these games previously on the unix and the mac,
  and thanks to Neil Bradley for pointing out the critical bug in the vector
  generator engine which prevented Tempest from working.

- Super Pac Man and Mappy have correct pitch now (thanks Aaron and Satoh).
  Also, SuperPac has speed cheat control again.

- Frogger doesn't have garbled chars anymore, and Galaga has correct stars
  speed now.

- Added support for KickRaider.  It's a rom swap, same hardware of Mr. Do
  Wild Ride.

- Patrick Lawrence added trackball sensitivity setting menu

- Morten Eriksen added hiscore save support to Arabian and AntEater

- Sound is back on williams games too

- Changed Dig Dug Atari rom dir into "digdugat", indicating the correct
  roms archive name.
