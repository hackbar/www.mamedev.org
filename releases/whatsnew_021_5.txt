0.21.5
- Nicola fixed a bug in Memory addressing that caused Galaga to trash
  under DOS.  Also, fixed colors in Elevator Action (100% correct colors)
  and Jungle King (I have some screenshots and colors doesn't match.  BTW
  these are much better than previous).  Finally Jungle King doesn't need
  to select the graphic bank, but still have some glitches on sprites.

- Fixed a bug in sound init of phoenix/pleiads that caused the game to
  crash under dos.

- Fixed a bug in keys redefinition routine:  ALT, SHIFT, and CONTROL are
  now selectable.

- Fixed 224x288 noscanline video mode.  It's centered again now.

Sources:
- Changed MSDOS.C to support 240x272 (video mode provided by V.Verrando)

- Changes in COMMON.C to copyscrollbitmap()
